# Multi RTL

This is just a complete copy of the [MultiRTL](https://github.com/ptrkrysik/multi-rtl) Repo.
We are using this repo for project research even though the original block no longer works with
GNU Radio.

### Sadly, Multi-RTL stopped working with GNU Radio 3.8

From the original README:

`Multi-RTL` is a GNU Radio block that transforms cheap multiple `RTL-SDR` receivers into multi-channel receiver. 

`Multi-RTL` is the first software solution that enables synchronous reception with each channel based on a `RTL-SDR` receiver tuned to a different central frequency. The synchronization is done automatically and in software - without the need for any additional electronical hardware.
